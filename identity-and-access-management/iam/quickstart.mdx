**I**dentity and **A**ccess **M**anagement (IAM) allows you to share access to the management of your Scaleway resources, in a controlled and secure manner. With IAM, you can:
- Invite other users to your [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#organization).
- Create IAM applications which represent non-human users of your Organization, giving programmatic access to resources.
- Define permissions for users and applications in your Organization can via highly customizable [policies](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#policy). Policies let you specify exactly what rights they should have to view, edit, create or manage different resources.
- Manage API keys for applications and users in your Organization. API keys inherit their permissions from the user or application they are associated with.

<Message type="requirement">

IAM is activated in your account. All existing configuration and functionality is automatically migrated into IAM for you, from the configuration of members and roles, to API keys.

Read our dedicated documentation to understand more about how your configuration is migrated, or read on to learn more about using IAM.

## How to invite a user to your Organization

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

2. Click the <Icon name="plus" /> button to add a user. The following screen displays:
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-invite-user.webp" alt="" />

3. Enter the email address of the person you want to invite. If you want to invite more than one user, enter multiple email addresses separated by commas. Optionally, you can also select a [group](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#group) to add the user to.

4. Click **Invite** to send the invitation.

    The user receives an email inviting them to accept your invitation. If they do not already have a Scaleway account, they will be prompted to [create one](/console/my-account/how-to/create-an-account/) first.

5. The user appears in the list of your Organization's users once they have accepted the invitation:

## How to create an application

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

2. Click the **Applications** tab. A list of the Organization's existing IAM applications displays:
    [TODO INSERT IMAGE]

3. Click the <Icon name="plus" /> button to create a new IAM application. The application creation wizard displays:
    [TODO INSERT IMAGE]

4. Complete the steps of the creation wizard:
    - Enter a name for the application, or use the auto-generated name suggested for you
    - Enter a description (optional)
    - Attach an existing policy to the application (optional)

    <Message type="note">
      You can choose not to attach a policy to the application at this stage. Unless your application is a part of a group, be aware that until you attach a policy to the application, it will have no permissions in your Organization.
    </Message>

5. Click **Create application** to finish. 

## How to give permissions to users and applications via policies

1. Click **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** from the top-right of your [**Organization Dashboard**](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. The **Users** tab of the [Identity and Access Management dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) displays.

2. Click the **Policies** tab. A list of the Organization's existing policies displays:

  [TODO INSERT IMAGE]

3. Click the <Icon name="plus" /> button to create a new IAM policy. The policy creation wizard displays:

  [TODO INSERT IMAGE]

4. Complete the steps of the first page of the creation wizard:
    - Enter a **name** for the policy.
    - Enter a **description** (optional).
    - Select a **principal**, who will be the target of your policy. The [principal](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#principal) should be the user, application or group who you want to give certain permissions to via this policy.

    <Message type="important">
      You can choose to create a policy without a principal for now, and attach the principal later. Be aware that the policy will have no effect until a principal is attached. A policy can only be attached to one principal at a time.
    </Message>

5. Click **Add rules** to progress to the next part of the policy creation wizard. 
    <Message type="tip">
      Rules define the actions that the attached principal will be able to carry out within the Organization. When creating a rule, you first set the **scope** of the rule, and then select the **permission sets** to apply within the scope. See our dedicated documentation for more help with [policies, rules, scopes and permission sets](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/policy/).
    </Message>

6. Select a **scope** for the rule:
    - To give the principal permissions to view, create, edit and/or delete [resources](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#resource), select the **Access to resources** scope. Then, select the [Project](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#project) in which you want the permissions to apply. You can select from **all current and future Projects**, **all current Projects** or select specific Projects.
    - To give the principal permissions to [Organization](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts#organization)-level features such as IAM, billing, support & abuse tickets and project management, select the **Access to Organization features** scope. 

7. Click **Validate** to continue.

8. Choose the **permission sets** for the rule by selecting the required boxes. You can select as many permission sets as you like. The principal will have the rights defined in these permission sets within the scope you set in step 6. See our dedicated documentation for [more help with permission sets](/identity-and-access-management/iam/reference-content/permission-sets). 

9. Click **Validate**. The rule, with its scope and permission sets, is added to the list of the policy's rules.

10. Click **Add new rule** and repeat steps 6-8 as many times as required to add multiple rules to your policy. 
    <Message type="tip">
      You can delete <Icon name="delete" /> or edit <Icon name="edit" /> an existing rule by clicking the relevant button in the top right corner of the rule's summary.
    </Message>

11. Click **Create policy** to finish.

    You are returned to the **Policies** tab, where the newly-created policy now appears in the list.
